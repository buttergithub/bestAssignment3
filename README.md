What is Logging? Logging is the process of recording information about the events and operations that occur within a software application. This information is typically written to a file, console, or logging service, and includes messages generated by the application, such as errors, warnings, informational messages, and debugging details.
Why is so important? 
-Logs help developers understand what the application was doing at a specific time, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
-Logs provide insight into the applicationâ€™s behavior and performance, allowing for proactive maintenance and optimization.
-Logs can record security-related events such as login attempts, access control violations, and other suspicious activities, aiding in detecting and responding to security threats.
-Logs can be used to maintain an audit trail of operations and transactions, which is often required for compliance with regulatory standards.
-Logs can be analyzed to gain insights into usage patterns, performance bottlenecks, and user behavior, helping to improve the application.
Understanding logging levels:
-DEBUG:
Detailed information, typically of interest only when diagnosing problems. Ex: Variable values, function calls, detailed flow of the application.
-WARN:
Potentially harmful situations which are not errors but could lead to problems. Ex: Deprecated API usage, configuration settings that are not optimal.
-INFO:
Informational messages that highlight the progress of the application at a high level. Ex: Application startup and shutdown, significant process milestones.
-ERROR:
Error events that might still allow the application to continue running. Ex: File not found, database connection issues.
-FATAL:
Very severe error events that will presumably lead the application to abort.Ex: Out of memory, critical system component failure.
